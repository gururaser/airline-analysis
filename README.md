To provide our clients with the best deals, we need to have a comprehensive understanding of airline prices. In this project, we will be analyzing the factors which affect airline prices to help our clients get the best value for their money.

Our favorite airline provides us with the following data for analysis:

- `miles`: miles traveled through the flight
- `passengers`: number of passengers on the flight
- `delay`: take-off delay in minutes
- `inflight_meal`: is there a meal included in the flight?
- `inflight_entertainment`: are there free entertainment systems for each seat?
- `inflight_wifi`: is there complimentary wifi on the flight?
- `day_of_week`: day of the week of the flight
- `weekend`: did this flight take place on a weekend?
- `coach_price`: the average price paid for a coach ticket
- `firstclass_price`: the average price paid for first-class seats
- `hours`: how many hours the flight took
- `redeye`: was this flight a redeye (overnight)?

By analyzing this data, we will gain insights into how airline prices change based on different factors. This will enable us to find the best deals for our clients and help them understand the factors that affect the price of airline tickets.
